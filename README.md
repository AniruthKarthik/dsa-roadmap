# 💎 The DSA Treasure Map: Master Patterns, Conquer Interviews

Welcome to your ultimate companion for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. This isn't just another problem tracker—it's a curated roadmap designed to transform how students and developers approach technical interviews. This repository is a **treasure trove** for anyone looking to build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving.

## 🌟 The Purpose: Patterns Over Memorization

For many students, DSA feels like an endless ocean of disconnected LeetCode problems. This site acts as your compass. We believe that **memorizing solutions is a recipe for failure, but mastering patterns is a recipe for success.**

By focusing on **Algorithmic Patterns**, you learn to recognize the underlying structure of a problem. Once you master a pattern like *Sliding Window* or *Two Pointers*, you don't just solve one problem—you gain the tools to solve hundreds of similar ones.

## 🚀 Key Features for Students

- **🧠 Pattern-Based Curriculum:** Problems are hand-picked and categorized by essential patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Fast & Slow Pointers, etc.).
- **📊 Visual Progress Tracking:** Sync your progress to the cloud with Netlify Identity or track locally. Watch your mastery grow pattern by pattern.
- **🏆 Global Leaderboard:** Compete with a community of fellow learners. Stay motivated and see where you stand among the "elites."
- **🎨 Minimalist Design:** A sleek, Apple-inspired UI that stays out of your way, allowing you to focus entirely on learning.
- **🔍 Advanced Filtering:** Search by problem name or filter by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) to match your current skill level.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, Modern CSS (Backdrop filters, Grid/Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Auth & Backend:** [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/products/identity/) & [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/).
- **Database:** Netlify's Identity metadata (No complex DB setup required!).

## ⚙️ How to Use This Treasure
